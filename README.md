# software-ventilador
Repository of the mechanical ventilator developed by Guilherme Torelly while working with Carlos 
Elias, Rodrigo Felix and Fabio Marujo at IME and CBPF.
The project aims to develop a cheap mechanical ventilator using a Raspberry PI as the base hardware.
It controls a pneumatic piston used to press an AMBU. The system measures flow, volume and pressure,
showing it in a touchscreen monitor also used to set the parameters for the ventilation cycles.
